Initial commit, 6/10/24 - A very bare bones colour picker created in Python using Tkinter and Pyperclip, which creates a hexadecimal string that can be copied and then pasted anywhere. I will be adding more features, functionality and a better looking GUI in the next few weeks/months to come. Apologies to any and all North Americans confused by the usage of "colour" as opposed to "color" in variable and function names. 

Update 7/10/24 - Rewritten in CustomTkinter for a much nicer looking GUI. Run "colourpicker_v1.0" to try it out. 

Another update, 7/10/24 - colour code can now be copied in either RGB or hexadecimal format.

FEATURES TO BE ADDED:
- CustomTkinter GUI [DONE]
- Option to copy string in RGB format (instead of hexadecimal) [DONE]
- Toggle switch for dark/light appearance mode [TODO]
- Add eyedropper for easier selection of custom colours [TODO]
- Clear default custom colours so users can add their own [TODO]

Usage:

You may need to install Pyperclip in order to use this script. Simply open a terminal and type ```pip install pyperclip``` for that.
Then, double click on the file and it will run!

Enjoy!
