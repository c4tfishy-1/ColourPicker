Initial commit, 6/10/24 - A very bare bones colour picker created in Python using Tkinter and Pyperclip, which creates a hexadecimal string that can be copied and then pasted anywhere. I will be adding more features, functionality and a better looking GUI in the next few weeks/months to come. Apologies to any and all North Americans confused by the usage of "colour" as opposed to "color" in variable and function names. 

Update 7/10/24 - Rewritten in CustomTkinter for a much nicer looking GUI. Run "colourpicker_v1.0" to try it out. 

Another update, 7/10/24 - colour code can now be copied in either RGB or hexadecimal format. Run "colourpicker_v1.1" to try it out.

Update, 8/10/24 - users can now toggle between dark/light mode. Run "colourpicker_v1.2" to try it out.

FEATURES TO BE ADDED:
- CustomTkinter GUI [DONE]
- Option to copy string in RGB format (instead of hexadecimal) [DONE]
- Toggle switch for dark/light appearance mode [DONE]
- Add eyedropper for easier selection of custom colours [TODO]
- Clear default custom colours so users can add their own [TODO]
- Option to copy string in HSL format (instead of hexadecimal/RGB) [TODO]
- Option to allow users to type/paste a colour code into the text boxes [TODO]
- Add a color picker to get a colour from the whole screen [TODO]
- Toggle switch for dark/light mode on the color picker window itself [TODO] (???)

Usage:
You may need to install Pyperclip in order to use this script. Simply open a terminal and type ```pip install pyperclip``` for that.
Then, double click on the file and it will run!

We recommend users exclusively use the latest version, as it will have more features than the others (and cleaner code).
Enjoy!
